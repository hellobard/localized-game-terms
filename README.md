Localized Game Terms - CROWD SOURCING

========================================

A crowd sourcing effort to get the most common terms in games localized into different languages. 
The basis is a CSV file, currently optimized/formatted for use with NGUI (for Unity 3D).

NOTES ON EDITING:

Editing the CSV requires that you use UTF-8 encoding, so either edit it directly via Github or use a CSV editor that saves in the right format. Google Docs works and "CSV Editor" for Mac is available in the App Store.

Please only contribute if you know the language in question, machine translations via Google Translate are NOT wanted for this project.

VERY IMPORTANT!
Using MICROSOFT EXCEL will NOT work, it messes up the language encoding!


====================

NOTES ON USAGE:

Please remember these are generic translations. You should have someone check the translations for you before using it.
